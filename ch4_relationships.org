Information is made up of relationships. 

The significance of a relationship will be referred to as its "reason". E.g
You => car, reason = owner.

The reason is an important aspect of the relationship; several different
relationships can exist between the same objects.

* Degree, Domain and Role
An instance of a relationship includes one thing from each category. The degree
of such a relationship would then be the number of categories in the defining pattern.
