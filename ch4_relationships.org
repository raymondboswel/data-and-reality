Information is made up of relationships. 

The significance of a relationship will be referred to as its "reason". E.g
You => car, reason = owner.

The reason is an important aspect of the relationship; several different
relationships can exist between the same objects.

* Degree, Domain and Role

** Degree
An instance of a relationship includes one thing from each category. The degree
of such a relationship would then be the number of categories in the defining
pattern.

** Domain
Domain designates all the things that may occur at a given position in the
relationship. Thus, an "owns" relationship has two domains, one contains
employees, departments, divisions; the other includes furniture, pencils,
vehicles etc.

** Role
The above can be improved by giving a name to the domain:
- owner
- owned

* Forms of binary relationship
