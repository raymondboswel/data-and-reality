* Sameness (Equality)

Counter part to the existence test => equality test; i.e when does two symbols
refer to the same entity?

** Tests

*** Match test
Simple comparison between the symbols. Entities are the same iff the symbols
themselves are the same.

*** Surrogate test
If the symbols refer to the same record (record with the same primary key) then
the symbols are equal.

*** List test
A list of synonyms are kept stating which symbols are judged to be the same.

*** Procedural test
Involves some arbitrary procedure by which the two symbols are judged equal.

** Failures
When equality is based on symbol matching, several kinds of erroneous results
can arise. 
 - If the things have aliases, equality will not be detected
 - If the symbols can be ambiguous, then spurious matches will occur. Different
things can match because their names match.

These concerns are especially relevant when trying to detect implicit
relationships based on matching symbols.
